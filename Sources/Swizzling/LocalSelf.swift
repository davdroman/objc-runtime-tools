/// A property wrapper that exists purely for the sake of the `swizzle` macro.
///
/// Normally the `self` keyword is reserved and cannot normally be used as a closure parameter.
///
/// `LocalSelf` allows the swizzled implementation block to have a `self` different from the outer
/// scope's `self`.
///
/// This is achieved by declaring `$self` as a closure parameter, which shadows the outer scope's `self`.
///
/// It's unclear whether this is a bug or a feature, but it's a nifty trick for now.
